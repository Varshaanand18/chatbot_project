# Chatbot Project

This project demonstrates the creation and fine-tuning of a chatbot using Hugging Face Transformers.

## Steps followed:
1. Load a pre-trained model and tokenizer.
2. Fine-tune the model using a custom dataset.
3. Compare outputs from different pre-trained models.
4. Save the fine-tuned model for future use.

## How to Run:
1. Install dependencies:
   - `pip install transformers datasets torch`
2. Run the chatbot using:
   - `python chatbot.py`
3. Follow the prompts to interact with the chatbot.

## Fine-Tuned Model:
- The fine-tuned model is saved in the `./results` folder.

## Files:
- `chatbot.py`: The main Python script.
- `qa_data.csv`: The dataset used for training.
- `results/`: Directory containing the fine-tuned model.
